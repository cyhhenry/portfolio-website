    <h1 class="about_me-header">Hi, my name is Henry, and I'm an aspiring web developer.</h1>
    <p class="about_me-item">I am 27 years old, and I am an avid reader and traveler. Originally from Hong Kong and having studied in the United States, I am now working toward an MA in American Studies and a web development program in Germany. I speak four languages with varying proficiency.<br>

      <br>After earning a Bachelor’s degree in English, where I graduated with a first, I worked briefly in marketing communications before pursuing a career in private education. For three years I served as the chief English editor for a major education provider in Hong Kong, where I managed a team of writers and freelancers to produce exam materials for school-leaving students. Meanwhile, I enrolled myself into a Master’s degree program in Literary and Cultural Studies, where I also graduated at the top of my class.<br>
      
      <br>As a high-flying student who had intended to embark on an academic career in Germany, I have decided, after some serious consideration, to make a pivot to a career in technology. If anything, the coronavirus pandemic has brought clarity to my life. Rather than indulging in high literature, I would like to carve out an impactful career that would also allow me to support myself financially. Lately I have signed up for a web development program at CareerFoundry, and in the months to come I will devote myself to building my portfolio — you are now looking at one of my projects.<br>
      
      <br>Coding is difficult, but nothing in life that is worth achieving is easy. I believe what makes me a stellar student will also make me an excellent web developer - my attention to detail, linguistic talent, and organizational skills that I learned from academic research are important qualities in a career in technology. For more on my academic and work experiences, feel free to take a closer look here:</p><br>
